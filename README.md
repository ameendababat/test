## Overview

Welcome to the **Programming from Scratch Roadmap** project! This roadmap is designed to guide beginners through the journey of learning programming from the very basics to advanced topics. Along the way, you'll gain hands-on experience with essential tools and concepts, including Git and GitHub, which are critical for modern software development.

## Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is divided into several stages, each focusing on a different aspect of programming:

1. **Introduction to Programming**: Understanding basic concepts like variables, data types, and control structures.
2. **Fundamental Programming Languages**: Starting with languages like Python or JavaScript to build a strong foundation.
3. **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Learning the building blocks of efficient coding.
4. **Web Development**: An introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating web applications.
5. **Version Control with Git and GitHub**: Managing code changes and collaborating with others.
6. **Advanced Topics**: Exploring areas like databases, APIs, and frameworks.
7. **Project Development**: Building a full-fledged project to consolidate your learning.

## Git and GitHub

### Git

As you progress through this roadmap, you'll learn to use **Git**, a powerful version control system that helps you track changes to your codebase, experiment with new ideas, and collaborate with others. Git is a critical skill for any developer, allowing you to manage your code history, work on multiple features simultaneously, and revert to previous states if needed.

### GitHub

**GitHub** is the platform where we will host our code and collaborate with others. It offers:

- **Repositories**: Centralized storage for your projects, where all your code and history are stored.
- **Branches**: Separate environments for working on different features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
- **Pull Requests**: A process for submitting your code changes, getting feedback from others, and merging them into the main project.
- **Issues and Project Boards**: Tools for tracking tasks, bugs, and progress.

Throughout the roadmap, you'll be guided on how to effectively use GitHub to collaborate on projects, contribute to open-source, and manage your own coding projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the roadmap, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/programming-from-scratch-roadmap.git
